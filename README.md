🧠 Technologies Used 
        •       Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
	•	Model Architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), UNet

 📊 How It Works
        1.	Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize starfield images, enhancing visibility of faint stars.
	2.	Model Training: Train a CNN on labeled star patterns to learn spatial relationships and features.
	3.	Pattern Matching: Compare detected patterns to predefined constellations for classification.


 🌌 Applications
        •	Astronomy: Automatic identification of celestial patterns in large datasets.
	•	Space Navigation: Use as a star sensor for spacecraft orientation.
	•	Education: A tool for amateur astronomers to explore and learn about the night sky.
